Rileybirds Music

Our band website: New Orleans-based husband-and-wife duo, Rachael and Joshua Riley play songs from the heart, born of stillness and the sacred love within. Inspired by their yoga and meditation practice, their message is simple… “relax, be loving.” Ranging from ancient mantras to conscious pop, The Rileybirds music explores what it means to live honestly and deeply vulnerable, in order to realize Truth and be unconditional love. The Rileybirds practice Bhakti yoga, offering a portion of the proceeds from their concerts, restorative soundbaths, and recordings to help communities in need.

Feel free to shop around and listen to some good soul-filling music!
